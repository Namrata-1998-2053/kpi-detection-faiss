# Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a real-time KPI detection engine using FAISS (HNSW) and sentence embeddings.  
It is designed to classify chat messages into predefined KPI categories with high accuracy and millisecond-level latency.

## Why This Project Matters

- Manual KPI tagging is slow and inconsistent  
- Simple keyword matching fails when phrasing changes  
- FAISS-based semantic matching offers speed + accuracy  
- System reduces manual QA load significantly

## What You Will Find Here

- Notebook demonstrating embeddings + FAISS search  
- Scripts for generating embeddings, building index, and predicting KPI  
- Sample baseline and message datasets  
- Full README explaining architecture
